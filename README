  Dragora is a trustworthy GNU/Linux-Libre distribution based on
the concept of simplicity with the goal of being a multi-purpose
operating system.

  Dragora respects the freedom of the user with the values of
free software and provides control to those who use it. It is
developed entirely by volunteers and it is published under
the terms of the GNU General Public License.


  Featuring the C library "musl" (http://www.musl-libc.org),
the 3.x release series of Dragora offers a new scheme in the
world of GNU/Linux distributions: an init system with service
supervision; a simplified structure of directories compatible
with the Standard FHS (http://www.pathname.com/fhs); the new
source builder and package manager called "chef"; portable
packages (statically linked) distributed using the POSIX
extension; lightweight alternative software..
and much more!

For installation instructions, read the INSTALL file.
