You need to select an image of a kernel to boot:

Press [F2] to view a complete list of available kernels.
Or press ENTER to boot with the default kernel (gen.k).

If you are having troubles with your system, type:

  gen.k root=/dev/sda1 rdinit= ro

In this example: /dev/sda1 is the Root Linux partition.
