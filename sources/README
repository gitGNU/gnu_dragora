All tar files are distributed, maintained, and updated in:

      rsync://antifaz.usla.org.ar/dragora/dragora-current/sources

Later, it is spread by the mirrors. Especially at:

         http://mirror.fsf.org/dragora/dragora-current/sources
                                  or
        rsync://mirror.fsf.org/dragora/dragora-current/sources

Uses GNU wget(1) to obtain all the files via the HTTP protocol:
# wget -w 1 -r -nd -np -R .html http://mirror.fsf.org/dragora/dragora-current/sources/

Or uses the tool rsync(1) to get all the files via the RSYNC protocol:
# rsync -rvaiz rsync://mirror.fsf.org/dragora/dragora-current/sources/ .

The tarballs are stored in the current working directory. It is suggested
to have cloned the repository (previously), and you are in the "sources/"
directory.

To check the integrity of all the tarballs using sha1sum(1), type:
# sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS.TXT

You can find more mirrors at http://dragora.org/en/mirrdev.html

Note:
     The tarballs are distributed in POSIX format,
     lzip (http://lzip.nongnu.org/lzip.html) is used for
     higher compression. You can find a copy of lzip in
     gzip format under the directory "sources/".
