gmp - The GNU multiple precision arithmetic library.

GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.
There is no practical limit to the precision except the ones
implied by the available memory in the machine GMP runs on.
