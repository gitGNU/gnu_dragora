ncurses - Emulation library of curses.

The Ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of
curses in System V Release 4.0.  The ncurses code was developed
under GNU/Linux. It has been in use for some time with OpenBSD
as the system curses library, and on FreeBSD and NetBSD as an
external package.

The distribution includes the library and support utilities,
including a terminfo compiler tic, a decompiler infocmp, clear,
tput, tset, and a termcap conversion tool captoinfo.
