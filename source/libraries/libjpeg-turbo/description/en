libjpeg-turbo - Library for JPEG images.

libjpeg-turbo is a high-speed version of libjpeg for x86 and x86-64 processors
which uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate baseline JPEG
compression and decompression.  libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast
as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.
