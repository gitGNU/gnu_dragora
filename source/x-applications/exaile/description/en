exaile - Amarok-like Media Player for GTK+.

Exaile is a media player aiming to be similar to KDE's Amarok, but for
GTK+. It incorporates many of the cool things from Amarok (and other
media players) like automatic fetching of album art, handling of large
libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album information via the
wikipedia, last.fm support, optional iPod support (assuming you have
python-gpod installed).
