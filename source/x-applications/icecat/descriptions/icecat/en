icecat - GNU version of the Firefox browser.

IceCat is the GNU version of the Firefox browser.  Its main advantage is
an ethical one: it is entirely free software. While the source code from
the Mozilla project is free software, the binaries that they release
include additional non-free software. Also, they distribute and
recommend non-free software as plug-ins.
