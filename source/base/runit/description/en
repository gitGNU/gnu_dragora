runit - A UNIX init scheme with service supervision.

Runit is a cross-platform Unix init scheme with service supervision,
a replacement for sysvinit, and other init schemes.  It runs on
GNU/Linux, *BSD, MacOSX, Solaris, and can easily be adapted to other
Unix operating systems.

Runit was written by Gerrit Pape.
