  Changes in the tools:

    - add:

        * Use options '--strip-components=1' and '--show-stored-names'

          the changes of "add".

  These are the current changes since previous version (2.2):

        * Version 2.3 released.
        * Centralized: Implemented a main order called `pkg'.
        * Modularized: The tools for: install, remove, and
          upgrade packages are now in a separate directory.
        * A new tool called "size" has been added.
        * Fixed localization issues + code correctness.
        
  Changes in the new tools:
  
    - add (ex dragin):
    
        * Now the testing and installation of packages is more fast,
          with the tar option '--use-compress-program='.
        * Preformatted descriptions using `fmt' for the output.
        * The descriptions can also be show in UTF-8 (according to the system).
    
    - remove (ex dragout):
    
        * A better version of the function cat_except() has been implemented.
    
    - upgrade (ex dragup):
    
        * Added a new option `-i' for install a package (if not installed).
        * The options are handled by getopts for more flexibility.
    
    - size:

        This is a new tool to get the compressed size and uncompressed
        size of a package.

    - erupt
    
        * Number of version: incremented.
