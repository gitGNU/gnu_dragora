psmisc - Small utilities that use the /proc filesystem.

The psmisc package is a set of some small utilities that
use the proc filesystem.

The package contains the following programs:

* fuser   - Identifies what processes are using files.
* killall - Kills a process by its name, similar to a pkill found in
            some other Unices.
* pstree  - Shows currently running processes in a tree format.
* peekfd  - Peek at file descriptors of running processes.
