udev - Dynamic device management.

Udev is the device manager for the Linux 2.6 kernel series.
Its primary function is managing device nodes in /dev.

It is the successor of devfs and hotplug, which means that
it handles the /dev directory and all user space actions
when adding/removing devices, including firmware load.
