/mnt:  Mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.

This directory is provided so that the system administrator may
temporarily mount a filesystem as needed.  The content of this
directory is a local issue and should not affect the manner in
which any program is run.

This directory must not be used by installation programs:
a suitable temporary directory not in use by the system
must be used instead.

See also the file README in the /media directory.
