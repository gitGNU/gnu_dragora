gzip - Compression utility.

Gzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be
a replacement for compress.  Its main advantages over
compress are much better compression and freedom from
patented algorithms.  It has been adopted by the
GNU project and is now relatively popular on the
Internet.

Gzip was written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.
