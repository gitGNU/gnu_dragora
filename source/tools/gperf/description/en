gperf - Perfect hash function generator.

GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator.  For a given list of
strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or
C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the input string.
The hash function is perfect, which means that the hash table has no
collisions, and the hash table lookup needs a single string
comparison only.
