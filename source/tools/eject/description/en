eject - Program for ejecting removable media.

Eject allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, or
JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under software control.  The command can
also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature
supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM
drives.
