hal - Hardware abstraction layer.

HAL is a hardware abstraction layer, which is a piece of software that provides
a view of the various hardware attached to a system. In addition to this, HAL
keeps detailed metadata for each piece of hardware and provides hooks such that
system and desktop-level software can react to changes in the hardware
configuration in order to maintain system policy.
