gpm - Utility and mouse server for virtual consoles.

The gpm daemon tries to be a useful mouse server for
applications running on the GNU/Linux console.  Its
roots are in the "selection" package, by
Andrew Haylett, and the original code comes from
selectionitself.

This package is intended as a replacement for
selection, to provide additional facilities.
