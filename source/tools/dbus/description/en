dbus - Message bus system.

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
one another.  In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a
"single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and
daemons on demand when their services are needed.
