sharutils - Shell archiver.

The sharutils package contains the GNU shar utilities, a set of tools for
encoding and decoding packages of files (in binary or text format) in a
special plain text format called shell archives (shar). This format can
be sent through email (which can be problematic for regular binary
files).
