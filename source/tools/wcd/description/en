wcd - Wherever change directory.

Wcd is a command-line program to change directory fast.  It saves time
typing at the keyboard. One needs to type only a part of a directory
name and wcd will jump to it. Wcd has a fast selection method in case
of multiple matches and allows aliasing and banning of directories.

Wcd was modeled after Norton Change Directory (NCD). NCD appeared
first in The Norton Utilities, Release 4, for DOS in 1987,
published by Peter Norton. NCD was written by Brad Kingsbury.
