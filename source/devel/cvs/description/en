cvs - Concurrent versions system.

Concurrent versions system (CVS) is a version control system which can
record the history of your files (usually, but not always, source
code).  CVS only stores the differences between versions, instead of
every version of every file you've ever created.  CVS also keeps a
log of who, when and why changes occurred.
