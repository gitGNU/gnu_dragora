poppler - Free software library for viewing PDF documents.

Poppler is a free software library for viewing PDF documents.
It is maintained by freedesktop.org.  Poppler is based on
Xpdf-3.0 codebase and was created for two stated reasons:
to allow easier reuse of the rendering engine to reduce
redundant work, and to go beyond the goals of Xpdf and
integrate more closely and reuse more functionality
provided by the operating system.
