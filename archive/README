  The "archive" directory contains specific files included by the packages.
Each subdirectory is represented with the name of the program. Usually
these files are configuration files, headers, or substantial files
that are not considered patches (differences). Each of them is located
in their corresponding directories to reflect where they come from.

  The only exception is the file "_hierarchyfs.tar.gz" which composes
the general structure of directories for the system.
