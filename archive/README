  The "archive" directory contains specific files included by the packages.
Each subdirectory is represented with the name of the program. Usually
these files are configuration files, headers, or substantial files
that are not considered patches (differences). Each of them is located
in their corresponding directories to reflect where they come from.

  The exceptions are the files "_hierarchyfs.tar.gz" which composes
the general structure of directories for the system, and the file
"bootscripts.tar.gz", which contains the init scripts for Dragora.
