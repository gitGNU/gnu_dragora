bash - Sh-compatible shell.

Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from
the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).  It is intended to conform to
the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 shell and tools standard.

It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and
interactive use.
