sqlite - Embedded SQL database engine.

SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases,
SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes
directly to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL database with multiple
tables, indices, triggers, and views, is contained in a single disk file.

This is the amalgamation version of SQLite.
