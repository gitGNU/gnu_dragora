1 Introduction
**************

Qi is a source builder and a package manager:

   It contains a set of tools where the main command is `qi', a wrapping
guide for the rest of the commands.  It follows the philosophy of the
simplicity without adding too many features, such as those that can be
found in popular package managers.  Basically it does two things:
builds packages and manages them.

   The building part can get or retrieve source code from remote sites
without the intervention of the developer or package maintainer.  It
downloads the source, reads the checksum, and annotates the same one in
the recipe.  This is done by the `build' command, checking the
integrity of the source and creating the checksum or updating it
without losing focus.

   Qi constructs the sources using recipe names, files that contain
specific instructions to build every source.  As result, a binary
package is obtained which can be installed, removed, upgraded, or
inspected in the system.  The software packages produced by Qi have the
.tlz extension; where, tar(1) is used for packaging, and lzip(1) is used
as the only compression format in the package redistribution.

   The packages are managed thanks to an external tool called graft(1),
which provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages under a
single directory hierarchy, it was inspired by both Depot (Carnegie
Mellon University) and Stow (Bob Glickstein).  In this aspect, Qi acts
as a complement of Graft: it can work with packages, check them, solve
conflicts, and more...

file: `qirc'.  If there are no options, and if `qirc' is not present,
default (internal) values will be used instead.

2.1 Help Actions
================

There are several levels of help in which the help is showed.  If `qi'
is invoked without arguments, then the general help appears.  Which is
also equivalent to `qi help'.

   Type `qi help <command>' for more information on a specific command.

If the help does not appear when a command is invoked without
arguments, please use `qi <command> -h'.

3 The qirc file
***************

`qirc' is the configuration file for Qi used at runtime during the
installation, removal of a package or when a recipe is built.  This
file is optional, and it can be useful to define variables and
configure external tools (such as a download manager) for default use.

   * Variables are declared as `name=value'.

   * Declaration of values should only take one line, no line break.

The options specified in the command-line can override the values
specified in the configuration file.  For more information, *note
Invocation::.

The order in which Qi looks for this file is:

  1. `${HOME}/.qirc'  Effective user.

  2. `${sysconfdir}/qirc'  System-wide.

   If you pretend to run Qi for a specific user, you should copy the
file `${sysconfdir}/qirc' to `${HOME}/.qirc' setting `${packagedir}'
and `${targetdir}' for `$HOME'.


File: qi.info,  Node: Recipes,  Next: Packages,  Prev: The qirc file,  Up: Top

4 Recipes
*********

A recipe is a file telling qi what to do.  Most often, the recipe tells
qi how to build a binary package from a source tarball.

   A recipe has two parts: a list of variable definitions and a list of
sections.  By convention, the syntax of a section is:

     section_name() {
       section lines
     }

   The section name is followed by parentheses, one space and an opening
brace.  The line finishing the section contains just a closing brace.
The section names or the function names currently recognized are
`build'.

   The `build' section is an augmented shell script.  This is the main
section which contains the instructions to build and produce a package.

4.1 Variables
=============

A "variable" is a *shell variable* defined either in `qirc' or in a
recipe to represent a string of text, called the variable's "value".
These values are substituted by explicit request in the definitions of
other variables or in calls to external commands.

   Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to
compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files,
directories to write output in, or anything else you can imagine.

   Definitions of variables in qi have four levels of precedence.
Options which define variables from the command-line override those
specified in the `qirc' file, while variables defined in the recipe
override those specified in `qirc' taking priority over those variables
settled by options via command-line.  Finally, some variables (outdir,
tmpdir, worktree, tardir, netget, rsync, arch, jobs, pkgname) have
default values if they are not defined anywhere.

   Options that set variables through the command-line can only
reference variables defined in `qirc' and variables with default values
(tmpdir, worktree, tardir, arch, jobs).

   Definitions of variables in `qirc' can only reference variables
previously defined in `qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in the recipe can only reference variables
settled by command-line, variables previously defined in the recipe,
variables defined in `qirc', and variables with default values.


File: qi.info,  Node: Packages,  Next: Examine packages,  Prev: Recipes,  Up: Top

5 Packages
**********

A package is a suite of programs usually distributed in binary form
which may also contain manual pages, documentation, or any other file
associated to a specific software.

   The Qi package format is a simple redistributable tar(1) archive
compressed with lzip(1).  The package extension ends in ".tlz".

Both package installation and package deinstallation are managed using
`${packagedir}' and `${targetdir}':

   `${packagedir}' is a common directory tree where the package contents
is decompressed (resides).  By default the tree is located at
*/usr/packages*.

   `${targetdir}' is a target directory where the links will be made
taking `${packagedir}/package_name' into account.

   Packages are installed in self-contained directory trees and symbolic
links from a common area are made to the package files.  This allows
multiple versions of the same package to co-exist on the one system.

Note: all the links to install or to remove a package is handled using
graft(1).  Since multiple packages can be installed or removed at the
same time, certain conflicts may arise between the packages.  According
to the User's Guide of Graft, a conflict is defined as one of the
following conditions:

   * If the package object is a directory and the target object exists
     but is not a directory.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is not a symbolic link.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the package
     object.

The Qi's default behavior is to not proceed with the installation when
a conflict occurs.  But when a package that is going to be removed is
in conflict with another package, graft(1) removes those parts that are
not in conflict, leaving the links belonging to the original package.
This behavior can be changed if the option -p is specified (see the
examples below).

   *For more information, check the documentation for graft.*

5.1 Package Installation
========================

This sort order is particularly useful just before the actual package
installation, because it helps you to understand how the package
installation works:

  1. The integrity of a package is checked.

  2. A subdirectory will try to be created if
     `${packagedir}/package_name' does not exist.

  3. The package is decompressed in `${packagedir}' using its name for
     the subdirectory.

  4. graft(1) is used to install symbolic links from the package
     installation directory to the target directory.

  5. If the file of description exists, and if it's not empty, the
     package description will be displayed.


*Examples:*

_Usage:_ qi install [-hNpvVw] [-P <dir>] [-T <dir>] package(s).tlz

   To install a single package, simply type:

     qi install coreutils-8.24-x86_64+1.tlz

   This shows:

     Processing '/etc/qirc' ...
     ==> Checking integrity of 'coreutils-8.24-x86_64+1.tlz' ...
     ==> Installing package 'coreutils-8.24-x86_64+1' in `/usr/packages' ...
     coreutils - The GNU core utilities.

     The GNU core utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
     utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
     which are expected to exist on every operating system.

   Multiple packages can be passed in a single invocation of `qi
install':

     qi install gcc-4.9.3-x86_64+1.tlz rafaela-2.2-i486+1.tlz ...

   Warn about the files that will be linked:

     qi install -w gcc-4.9.3-x86_64+1.tlz

   * This is a useful option to verify the content of a package before
     installing it.

   Seeing what happens when a package is installed (verbose mode):

     qi install -v mariana-3.0-x86_64+1.tlz

   * For a more detailed (long) output, you can use the -V option.

   Installing in a different directory tree and target:

     qi install -P /tmp/pkgdir -T /tmp/targetdir lzip-1.17-i486+1.tlz

   Forcing the package installation removing objects (files, links or
directories) from the target directory that are in conflict with the
package directory:

     qi install -p zutils-1.4-x86_64+1.tlz

   * It is useful to combine -p with -v or with -V.

5.2 Package Removal
===================

This sort order is particularly useful just before the actual package
deinstallation, because it helps you to understand how the package
deinstallation works:

  1. The packages are searched by name in `${packagedir}'.  Complete
     package names like "program-version-arch+release.tlz" or short
     names divided by segments "-" are accepted.

  2. If the specified name cannot be found at `${packagedir}', _remove_
     will try to find it expanding it, completing the name of the
     package.  If more than one package name matches, a menu of
     selection is generated to choose the packages.

  3. graft(1) is used to remove symbolic links from the package
     installation directory to the target directory.  By default, if
     there are a conflict with another package, it will remove those
     links that are not in conflict.  It's possible to prune all the
     conflicts using the -p option.

  4. Finally, the package directory is deleted if the option -k is not
     specified.


*Examples:*

_Usage:_ qi remove [-hNkpvV] [-P <dir>] [-T <dir>] package(s)

Where <package(s)>, partial names or complete package names can be
specified:

   - program-version-arch+1.tlz

   - program-version-arch+1

   - program-version-arch

   - program-version

   - program

   To remove a package, just execute the command:

     qi remove xz

   This will show:

     Processing '/etc/qirc' ...
     ==> Removing links of 'xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1' ...
     Uninstalling links from / to /usr/packages/xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1
     Processing   /usr/packages/xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1
     Processing   /usr/packages/xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1/usr
     Processing   /usr/packages/xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1/usr/bin
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/lzcat
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/lzmainfo
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xzfgrep
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xzdec
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/lzdiff
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xzdiff
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/unlzma
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xzegrep
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xzless
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xzcat
     UNLINK       /usr/bin/xz
     ...
     <== Removing package directory `/usr/packages/xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1' ...
     Deleting /usr/packages/xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1 ...
     1 package(s) removed = xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1

   If two or more versions of the same package are found, you can
choose the packages through the selection menu:

     qi remove xz
     Processing '/etc/qirc' ...

     The following package names were found according to your input:

     1) xz-5.0.8-i486+1
     2) xz-5.2.1-x86_64+1
     3) xz-5.2.0-x86_64+2
     4) All
     Pick a number, press <ENTER> to continue, or 'c' to confirm:

   If you pick a number followed by <ENTER>, you can continue selecting
individual packages (let's say 1 and 3).  Once you are ready, press 'c'
to confirm.  The last option selects all the packages.

   * Press <CTRL>+C to bail out.

If a conflict exist with another package, `remove' will try to delete
those links that are not in conflict.  It's possible to prune all the
conflicts using the -p option.

5.3 Final notes
===============

Some signals like SIGINT or SIGHUP are ignored in the package
installation, deinstallation.  The purpose of this is to ignore the
cancellation while a package is installed or removed (e.g. Ctrl+C,
terminal window closed).  Since installation or removal of a package
can be crucial for the proper functioning of the system.

6 Examine packages
******************

*erupt* is a special command to examine packages for debugging purposes:

_Usage:_ qi install [-h] [-d <dir>] package.tlz

   * This is equivalent to the shell instruction:

     `( umask 000 ; cd directory/ && tar -xvf package.tlz )'

     The permissions are set to "u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx" and the package
     content is decompressed inside a directory.

   * The specified package must be a regular file.

   * Only one package can be passed per-invocation.

   * A pre-existing directory is required to operate.

   * If you don't provide a different directory name using the -d
     option, the package is decompressed in the Current Working
     Directory.  The root directory (/) cannot be used for these
     purposes.

If you make some changes to the directory where the package is
decompressed, and has in mind to repackage.  We suggest increase the
build number of the package.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
